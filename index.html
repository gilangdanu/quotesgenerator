<li><h3>The inexpressible depth of music, so easy to understand and yet so inexplicable, is due to the fact that it reproduces all the emotions of our innermost being, but entirely without reality and remote from its pain. Music expresses only the quintessence of life and of its events, never these themselves.</h3><h3 class="author">~Arthur Schopenhauer</h3></li>

<li><h2>Every act of perception is to some degree an act of creation, and every act of memory is to some degree an act of imagination.</h2><h3 class="author">~Gerald M. Edelman</h3></li>

<li><h3>Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martialarts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.</h3>

<li><h3>Three or four times only in my youth did I glimpse the Joyous Isles, before they were lost to fogs, depressions, cold fronts, ill winds, and contrary tides … I mistook them for adulthood. Assuming they were a fixed feature in my life’s voyage, I neglected to record their latitude, their longitude, their approach. Young ruddy fool. What wouldn’t I give now for a never-changing map of the ever-constant ineffable? To possess, as it were, an atlas of clouds.</h3>

 <li><h3>There are unconscious processes controlling our thoughts and behaviours. What is new is the extent to which these processes are there to protect the self illusion – the narrative we create that we are the ones making the decisions. This stems from the need to maintain the appearance that we are in control, even when we are not. We are so concerned with maintaining the illusion of the sovereignty of self that we are prepared to argue that black is white just to prove that we are right.

 <li><h3>We tend to remember information that fits with our idealized self and conveniently ignore that which does not. If we believe that we have a particular trait of personality then we selectively interpret events that are consistent with that belief. In fact, we can easily interpret general statements to make them seem particularly relevant to us.

 <li><h3>Man must at last wake up out of his millenary dream and discover his total solitude, his fundamental isolation. He must realize that he lives on the boundary of an alien world; a world that is deaf to his music, and as indifferent to his hopes as it is to his sufferings and his crimes.

 <li><h3>In what meaningful way is a hard disk with one gigabyte of storage capacity less sentient than one with 128 gigabytes? Surely, it’s not just the amassing of more and more data that matters, but the relationships among the individual bits of data. The architecture of the system, its internal organization, is critical for consciousness.
</h3>
<h3 class="author">Christof Koch, Consciousness</h3>     

 <li><h3>If we honestly seek a single, rational, and intellectually consistent view of the cosmos and everything in it, we must abandon the classical view of the immortal soul. It is a view that is deeply embedded in our culture; it suffuses our songs, novels, movies, great buildings, public discourse, and our myths. Science has brought us to the end of our childhood. Growing up is unsettling to many people, and unbearable to a few, but we must learn to see the world as it is and not as we want it to be. Once we free ourselves of magical thinking we have a chance of comprehending how we fit into this unfolding universe.
</h3>

 <li><h3>As I stared out at the grim skyline, a bright sliver of the sun peeked over the horizon. Watching it rise, I performed a mental ritual: Whenever I saw the sun, I reminded myself that I was looking at a star. One of over a hundred billion stars in our galaxy. A galaxy that was just one of billions of other galaxies in the observable universe. This helped me keep things in perspective.

 <li><h2>...the sense of belonging to something, of being part of a pattern and of having a purpose. But it had all been illusory.</h2>
<h3 class="author">Susanna Clarke, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</h3>

 <li><h3>The box was small and oblong and apparently made of silver and porcelain. It was a beautiful shade of blue, but then again not exactly blue, it was more like lilac. But then again, not exactly lilac either, since it had a tinge of grey in it. To be more precise, it was the colour of heartache.

 <li><h2>When inequality is the general rule in society, the greatest inequalities attract no attention. But when everything is more or less level, the slightest variation is noticed
</h2>

 <li><h2>We may be happy enough with little if little is what we have come to expect, and we may be miserable with much when we have been taught to desire everything.
</h2>
<h3 class="author">Alain De Botton, Status Anxiety</h3>

 <li><h3>Wealth is not an absolute. It is relative to desire. Every time we yearn for something we cannot afford, we grow poorer, whatever our resources. And every time we feel satisfied with what we have, we can be counted as rich, however little we may actually possess.
</h3>
<h3 class="author">Alain De Botton, Status Anxiety</h3>

 <li><h2>A day of ghosts, most unwelcome and unawaited.

<h3 class="author">Nick Harkaway, Angelmaker</h3>

 <li><h3>Above all, he mistrusts duplication. A rare thing becomes a commonplace thing. A skill becomes a feature. The end is more important than the means. The child of the soul gives place to a product of the system.</h3>
<h3 class="author">Nick Harkaway, Angelmaker</h3>

 <li><h3>‘Destiny' is the state of perfect mechanical causation in which everything is the consequence of everything else. If choice is an illusion, what’s life? Consciousness without volition. We’d all be passengers, no more real than model trains.
</h3>
<h3 class="author">Nick Harkaway, Angelmaker</h3>

 <li><h3>Sometimes the plummy, playful verbiage is obnoxious. It conceals emotion. Actually, it mocks emotion, the better to pretend to be above it.
</h3>

 <li><h2>No craftsman stands alone, nor in his darkness lacks for light, nor has no shield against his patron’s spite.</h2>
<h3 class="author">Nick Harkaway, Angelmaker</h3>
