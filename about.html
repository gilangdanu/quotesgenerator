<h2>It's as easy as it gets. Hit the button and get showered with words. Hit more to get soaked wet. Use responsibly.</h2>
<h4><strong>Rain of Words</strong> is a small personal project by Gilang Danu, a word maniac who collects snippets of words from each books he read over the lifetime. This site is a repository of some of them, made with Concise CSS, a stack of JavaScript, Keith Clark's star field CSS, and Unsplash.it to generate random images. The site is ever-expanding, so if you want to submit your personal favorite quotes please do so. Email him at gilang@gilangdanu.com <br /><br />
 
PS: there's also Song for A Rainy Day, which got you soaked up in music lyrics. Still in progress, will be updated on regular basis.</h4>
